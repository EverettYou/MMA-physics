# Mathematica Packages for Physicists

## Contents

This repository contains *Mathematica* packages and stylesheets that are useful to my daily research.

- Packages

  - PauliAlgebra: symbolic handeling the algebra and representation of Pauli operators
  
  - LoopIntegrate: performing loop integration in quantum field theory (with dimension regularization)
  
  - MatsubaraSum: performing Matsubara summation analytically
  
  - DiagramEditor: an interactive editor of Feynmann diagrams (no diagramatic evaluation)
  
  - Themes: a self-made plot theme for Mathematica, called "Academic" (see the StackExchange discussion [Is it possible to define a new PlotTheme?](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/54545/is-it-possible-to-define-a-new-plottheme)) 
  
- Stylesheets

  - CMU Article: a Mathematica style sheet based on Computer Mordern Unicode fonts (the fonts need to be installed separated to the operating system, and the font files can be found in `./CMU fonts`)
  
- FrontEnd Configuration
